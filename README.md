OpenLANE has been usted to perrform RTL2GDSII. OpenLane is an open source ASIC design flow that can be used for tapeouts. It is a compilation of Yosys, abc, openROAD, FAULT, MAGIC, OpenSTA, ngspice and many other tools.
The tool has been accessed with "interactive" tag. Interactive mode of the tool will need manual intervention in each step to launch tool at every stage of the flow.
